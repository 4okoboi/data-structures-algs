# Simple Queue Data Structure 

A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the **First In First Out** (**FIFO**) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

## Basic Operations of Queue

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the queue is full 
- **Peek**: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it



## Queue Time Complexity
The complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue using an array is `O(1)`. If you use `pop(N)` in python code, then the complexity might be `O(n)` depending on the position of the item to be popped.
