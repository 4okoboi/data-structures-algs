# Stack data structure

A stack is a leaner data structure that follows the principe of **Last In First Out** (**LIFO**). This means the last element inserted the stack is removed first.

We can think of the stack data as the pile of plates on top of another.

## Basic Operations of Stack

- **Push**: Add an element on top of a stack
- **Pop**: Remove an element from the to of a stack
- **IsEmpty**: Check of the stack is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full 
- **Peek**: Get the value of the top element without removing it

## Stack Time Complexity 
All operations like pop or push take constant time, i.e. `O(1)`
